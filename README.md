# AngularJS Stock Market Quotes Single Page App (SPA)

This is an [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS styling framework SPA taken from [Anthony Alicea's](http://www.anthonypalicea.com) course on [Angular at Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/learn-angularjs/learn/#/). It pulls a financial markets data object returned in JSON from [Google Finance](http://finance.google.com/). It is using the previous [Angular Weather SPA](https://github.com/faddah/angular-weather-spa) as a starting basis from which to build.

It will made a number of modification to it, using Bootstrap classes and [Angular extra 'ng' classes](https://docs.angularjs.org/api).

[//] # "* I also pull the weather objects main & description in weatherReport.htm from the returned weather object and put those in each of the results."
[//] # "* I added two rows of Bootstrap buttons to choose how many days forecast you are viewing for the city's weather forecast in forecast.htm, with ng-class substituting out correctly with the 'btn-primary' or 'btn-diabled' depending if the button has been chosen or not."
